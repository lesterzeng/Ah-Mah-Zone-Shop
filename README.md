## Demo Website

  Objective : To create an e-commerce app that used could shop, add items to the cart, filled in shipping details, make payment and place orders.

Challenges: There were some components that had to stay responsive while navigating the app, for example;

- Cart details
- Address details
- Name of the user

It was achieved by setting items like cart quantity, address, names in the local storage.

Things to include for future development;

Include a payment screen.
Include a place order screen.
Include an order history screen.
In the cart screen, perhaps producgie an alert, "maximum quantity", after attempting to add beyond the last quantity in stock.
Need to redirect from Signin screen to, after signed in.
